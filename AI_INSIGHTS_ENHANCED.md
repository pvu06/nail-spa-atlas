## 🆕 New Features

### 1. **Market Opportunity Score (0-100)**

**What It Does:**
Calculates a comprehensive market attractiveness score based on multiple factors.

**Algorithm:**
```
Score = Quality Gap + Weak Competition + Market Saturation + Review Maturity

- Quality Gap: (4.5 - avgRating) × 20
- Weak Competition: (lowRatedCount / total) × 30
- Market Saturation: max(0, 30 - (density × 10))
- Review Maturity: min(30, (avgReviews / 100) × 10)
```

**Display:**
- Large score (0-100) with rating (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor)
- 3 key metrics: Average Quality, Weak Spots, Density per mi²
- Dynamic interpretation message

**Business Value:**
- Instant assessment: "Should I enter this market?"
- Quantifies opportunity at a glance
- Backs decisions with data

**Example Output:**
```
Score: 78 - Excellent
Avg Quality: 3.9⭐
Weak Spots: 4 salons
Density: 2.3/mi²
🎯 Excellent market conditions! Low competition with quality gaps.
```

---

### 2. **Price-Quality Matrix / Value Analysis**

**What It Does:**
Identifies positioning opportunities by analyzing price vs. quality relationships.

**Calculations:**
```typescript
Value Score = (Rating / Average Price) × 100

Best Value = Highest value score
Premium = Rating ≥ 4.5 AND Price > $50
Overpriced = Rating < 4.0 AND Price > $40
```

**Display:**
- Best Value competitor highlighted (green)
- Premium segment count (gray)
- Overpriced alert (red) - easy targets

**Business Value:**
- Find sweet spot pricing
- Identify overpriced competitors to undercut
- Validate premium positioning strategy

**Example Output:**
```
Best Value: Nail Palace (4.6⭐ at $35)
Premium Segment: 3 salons with 4.5+⭐ and $50+ pricing - High-end positioning viable
Overpriced Alert: 2 competitors charging premium prices with poor ratings - Easy to undercut
```

---

### 3. **Geographic Gap Analysis / Location Intelligence**

**What It Does:**
Analyzes spatial distribution of competitors to find underserved areas.

**Metrics:**
- Nearby Count (< 1 mile)
- Mid-Range Count (1-3 miles)
- Far Count (3+ miles)
- Average distance
- Maximum gap between competitors

**Smart Recommendations:**
```typescript
if (nearbyCount === 0) → "High opportunity in immediate area"
else if (midRangeCount < 2) → "Consider mid-range location (1-3 mi radius)"
else if (farCount > 50%) → "Market is geographically dispersed"
else → "Saturated within 1-3 mile radius"
```

**Display:**
- 3-column grid showing distribution
- Blue insight box with recommendation

**Business Value:**
- Optimal location selection
- Identify geographic voids
- Understand market coverage

**Example Output:**
```
Within 1 mi: 2
1-3 miles: 5

```

### 4. **Service Differentiation / Competitive Gaps**

**What It Does:**
Identifies missing amenities and luxury opportunities for differentiation.

**Analysis:**
```typescript
Standard Amenities = ['Wi-Fi', 'Parking', 'Wheelchair Accessible']
Luxury Amenities = ['Massage Chairs', 'Complimentary Drinks', 'VIP Room', 'Late Hours']

Missing = Standard amenities not offered by ANY competitor
Rare = Luxury amenities offered by < 20% of competitors
```

**Display:**
- Yellow box: Missing standard amenities (must-haves)
- Purple box: Rare luxury amenities (differentiators)
- Gray box: Total amenity count

**Business Value:**
- Baseline requirements (hygiene factors)
- Differentiation strategies
- Premium service ideas

**Example Output:**
```
⚠️ Missing Standard Amenities: Parking - Must-have basics
💎 Luxury Opportunities: Massage Chairs, VIP Room - Rare amenities for differentiation

## 🧮 Algorithms in Detail

### Market Opportunity Score Formula

**Inputs:**
- Average rating across all competitors
- Average review count
- Number of low-rated competitors (< 4.0)
- Market density (competitors per square mile)

**Calculation:**
```
qualityGap = max(0, (4.5 - avgRating) × 20)
// Higher score if avg rating is low (4.5 is "good" threshold)

weakCompetition = (lowRatedCount / totalCompetitors) × 30
// More weak competitors = more opportunity

marketSaturation = max(0, 30 - (density × 10))
// Lower density = more opportunity

reviewMaturity = min(30, (avgReviews / 100) × 10)
// Some reviews show established market (not dead)

finalScore = min(100, round(qualityGap + weakCompetition + marketSaturation + reviewMaturity))
```

**Interpretation:**
- **75-100 (Excellent)**: Low competition, quality gaps, great opportunity
- **60-74 (Good)**: Room for quality player, moderate opportunity
- **40-59 (Fair)**: Competitive but differentiation possible
- **0-39 (Poor)**: Saturated market, requires strong differentiation

---

### Price-Quality Value Score

**Formula:**
```
averagePrice = (gelPrice + pedicurePrice + acrylicPrice) / 3
valueScore = (rating / averagePrice) × 100

// Higher score = better value (high quality, low price)
```

**Benchmarks:**
- **Best Value**: Highest value score in market
- **Premium Viable**: 3+ competitors at 4.5★ & $50+
- **Overpriced**: Rating < 4.0 & Price > $40 (vulnerable)
